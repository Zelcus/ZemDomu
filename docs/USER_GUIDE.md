This repository contains the source code for ZemDomu, a VS Code extension that checks for semantic HTML issues.

## Development
To minimize the extension size, the build process bundles the compiled
JavaScript into a single file. Run the following commands to build and
package the extension:

```bash
npm run publish-all
```

Individual steps if you prefer to run them separately:

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run bundle
npm run package
```

The bundling step produces `dist/extension.js` with all runtime code inlined.
`node_modules/` is excluded via `.vscodeignore`, keeping the packaged
extension small.
